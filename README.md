## :information_source: About

Online tool to generate secure passwords

## :interrobang: Motive

I was looking for a good site that generates secure (random) passwords and decided to create this project. 
It is a personal project, the interface is pretty weak. It's just in case when you need to create a new password, use it. 
Who wants to contribute, be my guest!
